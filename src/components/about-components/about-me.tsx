					<p className="mb-2">
						I’m Koray, a front-end developer with a background in industrial
						engineering and a passion for building clean, responsive web
						interfaces.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						I mostly work with React and Next.js, and I really enjoy building
						clean, scalable interfaces with TypeScript and Redux. Over time,
						I’ve worked on everything from modernizing legacy code to creating
						new UI systems from scratch — always trying to keep things both
						functional and simple. Lately, I’ve been diving into backend
						development and experimenting with AI tools — just trying to
						understand more of the full picture and build things that actually
						work well from end to end.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						While I am not working, I am usually reading, working out, painting
						minis, or learning something new.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						Outside of code, I’m into analog photography, ancient philosophy
						(Socrates and Plato are favorites), and the dark lore of Warhammer
						40k — from books to brushes. I dream of riding a Triumph 900 across
						borders, capturing quiet moments on film, and pitching a tent where
						the sky feels endless.
