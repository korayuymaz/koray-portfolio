				<div className="text-md">
					<p className="mb-2">
						I’m Koray, a front-end developer with a background in industrial
						engineering and a passion for building clean, responsive web
						interfaces.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						I mostly work with React, TypeScript, and Redux, and I’m currently
						expanding into Vue, Next.js, and Tailwind. I enjoy working on
						scalable UI systems, modernizing legacy code, and making things both
						functional and elegant.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						While I am not working, I am usually reading, pumping iron, or
						learning something new.
					</p>
					<p className="mb-2">
						Outside of code, I’m into analog photography, ancient philosophy
						(Socrates and Plato are favorites), and the dark lore of Warhammer
						40k — from books to brushes. I dream of riding a Triumph 900 across
						borders, capturing quiet moments on film, and pitching a tent where
						the sky feels endless.
